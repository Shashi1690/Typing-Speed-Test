A clean, responsive, and interactive web application built to test and measure typing speed and accuracy. This project is created with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a straightforward user experience and clear, manageable code.
## Features

   - Live Performance Metrics:

       - WPM (Words Per Minute): See your typing speed calculated in real-time.

       - Accuracy: A live percentage of your typing accuracy.

       - Timer: A countdown timer to keep track of the test duration.

        Character Count: See a running total of correct vs. typed characters.

    Selectable Test Durations: Users can choose between 30, 60, or 90-second test intervals.

    Dynamic Text Samples: A new random paragraph is loaded for each test to ensure a fresh challenge every time.

    Results Modal: At the end of the test, a clean modal pops up displaying the final WPM and accuracy scores.

    Fully Responsive: The layout is designed to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
